        You can create a wallet or import one. To import one, you must have the
        secret key of the wallet you&#39;re trying to import. Dont worry we
        don&#39;t store your secret key on our side. It&#39;s only on your
        device.

          The bank button will deposit that cryptocurrency as XRP to your
          CryptoMe wallet. The paper airplane button allows converting your XRP
          to the cryptocurrency you&#39;re trying to receive in your other
          wallet. e.g. coinbase wallet if you want to receive bitcoin in that
          wallet.

        <p>
          Following Left Image: As an example, if you wanted to send 1 BTC from
          your coinbase account into CryptoMe, you would press the bank button
          next to BTC on the exchange and would be sent to the following page.
          Enter 1 BTC and the corresponding amount of XRP that will be deposited
          to your CryptoMe wallet will be shown. Please enter the BTC wallet
          address from Coinbase as a safety measure in case this transaction
          does not go through so your BTC will be returned to that wallet in
          Coinbase.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Following Right Image: On the following page with the QR code, you
          receive instructions. Send 1 BTC to 33ss6k9jeHEC91NujC….. BTC address,
          which is a Changelly Address, a service that provides cryptocurrency
          conversions. In this case, your wallet address would be raa6pj…. 1 BTC
          sent from your Coinbase account to the Changelly address would deposit
          46633.4857 XRP to your XRP address in CryptoMe
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
