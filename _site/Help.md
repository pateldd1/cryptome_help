## Depositing XRP into your CryptoMe wallet

### 1. Create or import an xrp wallet

- You can create a wallet or import one. To import one, you must have the secret key of the wallet you're trying to import. Dont worry we don't store your secret key. It's only on your device.

### 2. Deposit XRP into your account by converting from 30+ cryptocurrencies into XRP. A minimum of 20 XRP is required in any new ripple wallet

- The bank button will deposit that cryptocurrency as XRP to your CryptoMe wallet. The paper airplane button allows converting your XRP to the cryptocurrency you're trying to receive in your other wallet. e.g. coinbase wallet if you want to receive bitcoin in that wallet.

- To deposit xrp from another xrp wallet, simply send to your xrp wallet in CryptoMe.
